The following is a documented idea of Team Vision regarding "Predicting Natural Disaster Challenge" for Microsoft CodeFunDo++ Program

The natural disaster we would be working on is Floods. Our entire project will be divivded into two parts. First part will be prediction of floodsand the second part will be about prevention of floods.
Prevention of Floods:
The prevention of floods will be our primary motive and will be decided by a scale which will depend on a database developed by us. According to the scale we can decide what are the chances of the occurence of floods, accordingly the warnings and safety measures will be deployed so that the general ublicmay be ready for it. The scale is generated by the database which has the data including the possibility of various factors such as topograpgy of land, ecologically fragile areas, number of dams in a particular areas, yearly rainfall in that particular area, weather forecast data.

Prevention and safety measures:
This will be a three phase process.
